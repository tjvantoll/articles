# I Watched All 27 React Europe Talks So You Donâ€™t Have To

Ok, you still might want to watch the talksâ€”they were quite good! But weâ€™re all busy people, so I thought you all might appreciate my notes from all twenty seven [React Europe](https://www.react-europe.org/) talks.

The notes should help you quickly get a sense of what each talk covered, so you can decide if you want to watch the full video or not.

## I have exactly one hour, which talks should I watch?

Thatâ€™s a very specific question, but I have an answer.

First you should watch [_Recoil: State Management for Today's React_](#recoil), as Dave McCabe presented an interesting new way of handling global scope in React apps

Next, watch [_Excalidraw: Cool JS Tricks Behind the Scenes_](#excalidraw), as Christopher Chedeau discussed the challenges him and his team solved building a really useful drawing app.

Technically, watching these two talks will take 81 minutes, but if you watch at 1.25 speed on YouTube you can get it done in an hour ðŸ˜‰

## Do you need to shamelessly plug anything before providing your useful notes?

What a convenient question!

We at [KendoReact](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/) held a virtual hackathon at the event, which led to a lot of awesome React apps built with our UI components. We wanted to give a special shout out to the winner, Steeven Regnault, as he built a [fun little game using KendoReact and Recoil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RX9IbyY090o&feature=youtu.be).

Ok, on to the talk notes. Enjoy ðŸ™‚

## State of React Animations

* Speaker: [John Adetutu](https://twitter.com/johnadetutu93)
* [react-spring](https://www.react-spring.io/) is a powerful way to create animations in React.
* react-spring has series of hooks that allow you to separate your UI code from your animation logic.
* Check out this talk if youâ€™re looking to add some more robust ways to configure animations in your React apps.

## The Latest in Next.js 9.4

* Speaker: [Tim Neutkens](https://twitter.com/timneutkens)
* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is a React framework with a number of features to help you build React apps faster.
  * For example you can have a `pages` directory, and files in that directory automatically become routes.
  * Automatic prefetching of links on fast connections.
  * Ways of automating static generation.
* Coming soon to Next are smarter JavaScript bundles (only shipping old JavaScript bundling for older browsers), a faster development refresh cycle, a new error overlay, improved environment support (built-in `.env` loading), redirects, Eslint integration, and React concurrent mode support.
* Check out this talk if youâ€™re curious about Next.js and want an introduction into what it can do for you.

## Bringing WebGL to React

* Speaker: [Paul Henschel](https://twitter.com/0xca0a)
* [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/react-spring/react-three-fiber) is a reconciler for three.js.
  * Essentially, the library allows you to work with three.js easier by providing reusable components.
* He featured a bunch of examples that were pretty impressive. [This one](http://taotajima.jp/) and [this one](https://qf8d0.csb.app/) were my favorites, and theyâ€™re worth trying for yourself.
* Check out this talk if youâ€™ve been thinking of trying out WebGL, as react-three-fiber makes it a lot easier for React developers.

## Gatsbyâ€™s Roadmap and its Future

* Speaker: [Sidhartha Chatterjee](https://twitter.com/chatsidhartha)
* Static sites have have become increasingly possible over the last few years.
* Gatsby allows you to build static sites using React that you can serve from a CDN.
* Some limitations of static sites are really big sites, and sites that update very frequently.
* Gatsby Flow helps solve the problem of large sites with incremental builds.
* Gatsby streaming builds is an upcoming service that helps sites that need to update frequently.
* Watch this talk if youâ€™re interested in Gatsby, and some of the new services its working on.

## Render Props are Not Dead

* Speaker: [Erik Rasmussen](https://twitter.com/erikras)
* Render props greatly simplified the process of managing state in React components.
* Render props killed higher-order components. (https://twitter.com/mjackson/status/885910701520207872)
* Render props allow you to inject state without forcing a re-render of your entire component. Using hooks you have to create custom components every time to achieve this.
* This talk was one of my favorites as Erik is an amazing presenter. Iâ€™d say this one is worth watching for all React developers, but especially if you (like me), donâ€™t understand render props well and want to learn more.

## Beyond Responsive Design: Building Mobile-Optimized Websites in React

* Speaker: [Alex Holachek](https://twitter.com/alex_holachek)
* Taps on mobile are not the same as clicks on desktop, and you canâ€™t handle them the same.
* You can use `@media (pointer: fine)` to limit active and hover states to non-touch devices.
* For best customizability and cross-platform performance, it makes sense to apply & remove tap states with JavaScript.
* We need to strike a balance between applying the tap state fast enough for responsiveness (<100 ms), but not so fast the user accidentally triggers it when making another gesture like scroll.
* [bundle-wizard](https://github.com/aholachek/bundle-wizard) is a handy tool Alex built to visualize your JS bundles for any specific page of your app.
* This is a great talk for anyone building responsive apps, as there are a number of great tips and tricks.

<h2 id="recoil">Recoil: State Management for Today's React</h2>

* Speaker: [David McCabe](https://github.com/davidmccabe)
* Davidâ€™s team at Facebook hit some limits with state management, and they built a library to help solve them.
* The tool offers a flexible shared state, derived data and queries, and app-wide state observation.
* The name of the library is [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/).
* Recoil makes it easy to store app-wide state, which makes it easier to do time-travel debugging, and to do things like easily sharing the app state through a URL.
* The tool is experimental for now and the team is looking for feedback.
* This talk is a must watch. Everyone needs state management in React, and Recoil is an interesting new approach for making state management easier.

## Design System and Accessibility

* Speaker: [Devon Govett](https://twitter.com/devongovett)
* Building a set of UI components to use throughout your company is a huge challenge, especially as you consider accessibility, internationalization, and so on. (A problem weâ€™re very familiar with at KendoReact ðŸ™‚ )
* Devon covers a number of techniques his team used to solve some of these challenges, like dealing with UI challenges on mobile, and making components screen-reader friendly.
* Adobe is building a tool for making these things easier called React-Aria, and will be open sourcing it by the end of the month.
* Check out this talk if youâ€™d like to hear how Adobe is addressing accessibility in a new tool theyâ€™re building.
