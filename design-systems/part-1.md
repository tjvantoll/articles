# The Ultimate Guide to Building a UI Library for Your Company‚ÄîPart 1: Creating a Plan

Hot take‚Äî**every company should have their own library of UI components**. UI component libraries enforce consistency throughout your organization, both with visuals (how your company‚Äôs apps look), and with technologies (which frameworks and dependencies your company‚Äôs apps use).

But building a corporate component library is also hard, as you have to deal with both organizational problems, like getting permission from management to work on components, as well as technology problems, like determining which frameworks you‚Äôre going to use (if any), and how are you going to distribute your components to your company‚Äôs applications.

I‚Äôve spent the greater part of my 15+ years in the JavaScript world working with UI components, both as a member of the jQuery UI team, and now as a member of the Kendo UI team at Progress. In this article series I will share advice and strategies I‚Äôve learned that can help you build your own corporate component library. Here‚Äôs what you can expect from this series:

* **Part 1‚ÄîCreating a Plan**: (you‚Äôre here) You‚Äôll learn how to plan a component library, including how to convince management and your coworkers that building a component library is a good idea, and how to select a JavaScript framework to use.
* **Part 2‚ÄîEstablishing a Development Environment**: You‚Äôll learn how to set up your component library, with a focus on setting up a productive development environment.
* **Part 3‚ÄîBuilding Robust Components**: You‚Äôll learn how to approach building individual components, with a focus on how to work with dependencies.

Let‚Äôs start by looking at how to get the process started.

## How to get started

Starting a new corporate component library can seem like a daunting task. Your end goal is to have a set of components your entire organization can use, but most companies have a disparate set of apps built with a variety of different frameworks and technologies.

With that challenge in mind, my recommendation is to start small. Pick two or three components that your company already has (button, headers, footers), and build them in library that exists outside of any individual application. (You‚Äôll learn the workflow I prefer to use for this in part 2.)

To help find the specific components to build, I recommend starting by doing an [interface inventory](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/interface-inventory/), which has you catalog every permutation of components your company uses in a single document.

Creating an interface inventory serves two purposes. First, it can help you recognize which components you should start with for your library. (Look for simple components that lots of different applications use.) But more importantly, an interface inventory is a great way to convince management that building a component library is worthwhile. The reason being‚Äîmost companies that do an inventory discover that they have a mess of similar-yet-different components.

Once you have a handful of simple components selected you‚Äôre ready to start building. But before you start writing code you have one additional problem to address.

## How to choose a JavaScript framework

One of the most challenging parts of writing components for an entire organization is deciding on a framework to use, if any. At large companies it‚Äôs fairly common to have apps built with a variety of front-end frameworks‚Äîboth because enterprise apps tend to stick around for a long time, and also because developers have different opinions on what the ‚Äúbest‚Äù framework is.

This fragmentation is a problem when it comes to building components that you intend to use in a standard way throughout an organization. When building a component library you have three options for how to deal with this situation.

**Option 1: Choose one framework**

With this option you build all of your components with one framework‚Äîaka you build either React components, or Angular components, or Vue components.

This option makes the most sense for companies that have either standardized on a single framework for all of their applications, or have picked a single framework as their preferred option for new app development.

**Option 2: Support multiple frameworks** 

With this option you build your components multiple times, once for each framework you need to support.

This option sounds bad‚Äîwhat developer wants to write anything multiple times?‚Äîbut even though your are writing components multiple times, you do get to share a surprising amount of code, such as your markup structure, and the CSS to style your components.

**Option 3: Write framework-agnostic components**

With this option you build all of your components without frameworks like React, Angular or Vue, and you building your components on top of the browser‚Äôs web component APIs.

Although this option seems appealing‚Äîwho wouldn‚Äôt want components that can work in any app?‚Äîthe downside is most developers have a lot more experience working with their framework of choice than they do with web components. And although web components have come a long way in the last decade, they still don‚Äôt offer many of the features that frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue offer out of the box.

## Making a framework decision

The correct option for your company depends on your team and the applications you support.

That being said, I recommend that most companies start with #1 (choosing one framework), and moving on to #2 (support multiple frameworks) if necessary to get your components into multiple apps.

Over the years I‚Äôve found that developers are most productive when they get to use a framework they‚Äôre familiar with‚Äîaka React developers are most productive when they use React components, Angular developers are most productive when they use Angular components, and so on.

At Progress we also use this approach for Kendo UI. Specifically, instead of offering one Kendo UI that works with any framework, we offer Kendo UI for jQuery, Kendo UI for Angular, KendoReact, and Kendo UI for Vue‚Äîeach built from the ground up with their respective framework. As you might imagine this is a lot of work, but our users have consistency told us they prefer framework-specific components over framework-agnostic components.

I‚Äôd encourage you to also think about the type of components you yourself like to use. For example, if you‚Äôre a React developer that needs a datepicker, which are you more likely to use, a generic datepicker that you have to mess with to work with React, or a datepicker that was built by React developers with APIs you recognize?

Because I feel strongly that building framework-specific components is the right choice, that‚Äôs the approach we‚Äôll use in the next article in this series. Specifically, we‚Äôll take approach #1 (choose one framework), and build our example component suite with React. 

Although you‚Äôll be using React, you‚Äôll learn how to build a project structure that can support approach #2 (support multiple frameworks), as oftentimes that‚Äôs a necessity for companies that have apps built with several different frameworks.

## Next steps

At this point, you‚Äôve now decided on a small handful of components, and a framework that you need to build your components with‚Äîmeaning, it‚Äôs time to start coding.

In this next part of this article you‚Äôll learn how to create a development environment for building components from scratch. Stay tuned üôÇ
