# The Ultimate Guide to Building a UI Component Library: Creating a Plan

**Every company should have a standard library of UI components**. Component libraries enforce consistency throughout your organization, both visually (how your company‚Äôs apps look), and technologically (which frameworks and dependencies your company‚Äôs apps use).

But building a corporate component library is also hard, as you have to deal with both organizational problems, like getting permission from management to work on components, as well as development problems, like determining which frameworks you‚Äôre going to use (if any), and how are you going to distribute components to your company‚Äôs applications.

I‚Äôve spent over a decade working with UI components on the web, both as a member of the jQuery UI team, and now as a member of the [Kendo UI](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-ui) team at Progress. In this article series I will share advice and strategies I‚Äôve learned that can help you build your own corporate component library‚Äîwhether you‚Äôre building your own components from scratch, or whether you‚Äôre building on top of an existing set of components. Here‚Äôs what you can expect from this series:

* **Part 1‚ÄîCreating a Plan**: (you‚Äôre here) You‚Äôll learn how to plan a component library, including how to convince management and your coworkers that building a component library is a good idea, and how to select a JavaScript framework to use.

* **Part 2‚ÄîEstablishing a Development Environment**: (coming soon) You‚Äôll learn how to set up your component library, with a focus on setting up a productive development environment.

* **Part 3‚ÄîBuilding Robust Components**: (coming soon) You‚Äôll learn how to approach building individual components, including a discussion on whether you should build your own components from scratch, add dependencies on existing libraries, or do some combination of both.

Let‚Äôs start by looking at how to get the process started.

## How to get started

Starting a new corporate component library can seem like a daunting task. Your end goal is to have a set of components your entire organization can use, but most companies have a disparate set of apps built with a variety of different frameworks and technologies.

With that challenge in mind, my recommendation is to start small. Pick two or three components that your company already has (button, headers, footers), and build them a in library that exists outside of any individual application. (You‚Äôll learn the workflow I prefer to use for this in part 2.)

To help find the specific components to build, I recommend starting by doing an [interface inventory](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/interface-inventory/), which has you catalog every permutation of components your company uses in a single document.

Creating an interface inventory serves two purposes. First, it can help you recognize which components you should start building in your library. (Look for simple components that many applications use.) But more importantly, an interface inventory is a great way to convince management that building a component library is worthwhile. The reason being‚Äîmost companies that do an inventory discover that they have a mess of similar-yet-different components, and seeing 17 different button permutations can help change a hesitant manager into someone happy to devote development time on a project that establishes a standard set of components.

Once you have a handful of simple components selected, you‚Äôre ready to start building. But before you start writing code you have one additional problem to address.

## How to choose a JavaScript framework

One of the most challenging parts of writing components for an entire organization is deciding on which JavaScript framework to use, if any. At large companies it‚Äôs common to have apps built with a variety of front-end frameworks‚Äîboth because enterprise apps tend to stick around for a long time, and because developers have different opinions on what the ‚Äúbest‚Äù framework is.

This fragmentation is a problem when it comes to building components that you intend to use in a standard way throughout an organization. You have three options for how to deal with this situation.

**Option 1: Choose one framework**

With this option you build all your components with one framework‚Äîaka you build either all React components, or all Angular components, or all Vue components.

This option makes the most sense for companies that have either standardized on a single framework for all of their applications, or have picked a single framework as their preferred option for new app development.

If your company is moving all apps towards a single framework, having a standard component library can help you migrate apps faster, as you‚Äôll have a set of ready-to-use components.

**Option 2: Support multiple frameworks** 

With this option you build your components multiple times, once for each framework you need to support.

This option sounds bad‚Äîwhat developer wants to write anything multiple times?‚Äîbut even though you‚Äôre writing components multiple times, you do get to share a surprising amount of code, such as your markup structure, and the CSS to style your components.

**Option 3: Write framework-agnostic components**

With this option you build all your components without frameworks like React, Angular or Vue, and you instead build your components on top of the browser‚Äôs web component APIs.

Although this option seems appealing‚Äîwho wouldn‚Äôt want components that can work in any app?‚Äîthe downside is most developers have a lot more experience working with their framework of choice than they do with web components. And although web components have come a long way in the last decade, they still don‚Äôt offer many of the features that frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue offer out of the box.

## Making a framework decision

The correct option for your company depends on your team and the applications you support. That being said, I recommend that most companies start with #1 (choose one framework), and moving on to #2 (support multiple frameworks) if necessary.

Over the years I‚Äôve found that developers are most productive when they get to use a framework they‚Äôre familiar with‚Äîaka React developers are most productive when they use React components, Angular developers are most productive when they use Angular components, and so on.

At Progress we also use this approach for Kendo UI. Specifically, instead of offering one Kendo UI that works with any framework, we offer [Kendo UI for jQuery](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-jquery-ui), [Kendo UI for Angular](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui), [KendoReact](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/), and [Kendo UI for Vue](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-vue-ui)‚Äîeach built from the ground up with their respective framework. As you might imagine this is a lot of work, but our users have consistency told us they prefer framework-specific components over framework-agnostic components. And we do get to share some code across all frameworks, for example [Kendo UI‚Äôs robust theming system](https://themebuilder.telerik.com/) works the same regardless of which JavaScript framework you use.

If you‚Äôre still struggling to decide on a framework, I‚Äôd encourage you to think about the type of components you yourself like to use. For example, if you‚Äôre a React developer that needs a datepicker, which are you more likely to use‚Äîa web-component-based datepicker that you have to figure out how to use in React, or a datepicker that was built by React developers with APIs you recognize?

Because I feel strongly that building framework-specific components is the right choice, that‚Äôs the approach you‚Äôll use in the next article in this series. Specifically, you‚Äôll learn how to build a component library with approach #1 (choose one framework), and you‚Äôll build the components themselves with React.

Although you‚Äôll be using React, you‚Äôll learn how to build a project structure that can support approach #2 (support multiple frameworks), as oftentimes that‚Äôs a necessity for companies that have apps built with several different frameworks.

## Next steps

At this point, you‚Äôve decided on a small handful of components to build, and you‚Äôve decided on a JavaScript framework you‚Äôll use to build your components with‚Äîso it‚Äôs time to start coding!

In this next part of this article series, you‚Äôll learn how to create a development environment for building components from scratch. Stay tuned üôÇ
