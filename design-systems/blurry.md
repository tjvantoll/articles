# The Line Between the Client and the Server is Getting Blurry

When I started my career, developers trusted the browser with their code about as much as we collectively trust George R. R. Martin to complete the Game of Thrones books. If you were feeling risky you might write a bit of JavaScript for form validation, but you made sure all your _real_ code ran on a proper server, and with a proper language like .NET, Java, or PHP.

Fast forward a decade (or two) and things had changed drastically. JavaScript was now radically faster, and the hip thing to do was build Single Page Apps (SPAs) with frameworks like AngularJS. Servers were still a part of your tech stack, and probably ran your API and database, but your UI was now 100% driven by client-side code.
