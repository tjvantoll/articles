# What React 17 Means for Developers

Last week, the React team announced a release candidate of React 17 with the meme-friendly headline, “No New Features”.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">React 17 roadmap leaked <a href="https://t.co/gvYL5x87zE">pic.twitter.com/gvYL5x87zE</a></p>&mdash; Daniel Ramirez (@drmzio) <a href="https://twitter.com/drmzio/status/1292951064648380417?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 10, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## Gradual updates

From the blog:

> “React 17 enables gradual React upgrades. When you upgrade from React 15 to 16 (or, soon, from React 16 to 17), you would usually upgrade your whole app at once. This works well for many apps. But it can get increasingly challenging if the codebase was written more than a few years ago and isn’t actively maintained. And while it’s possible to use two versions of React on the page, until React 17 this has been fragile and caused problems with events.”

## developer fatigue?

hooks are still new to most people
