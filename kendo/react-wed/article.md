# Introducing React Wednesdays

My favorite thing about working in software was going to events and meeting others that are passionate about working with code. So when the world fell apart, we decided we needed to do our best to bring this same experience to the digital world.

Introducing [**React Wednesdays**](https://www.telerik.com/react-wednesdays), a weekly hangout with the best and brightest from the React world.

## How does it work?

Every week at 1:00 PM US Eastern time we go [live on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/codeitlive), and, well, chat. We bring on experts on various React topics, ask them questions, and sometimes have them do a bit of coding for us.

The great thing about being on Twitch is the audience—that’s you!—can get involved too. Feel free to ask questions, or to just hang out—if nothing else we should be more fun than your Q3 planning meeting.

## Can I view some past shows?

Yep, they’re [all up on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLGlTD7u3kMr6E8-P6r0MkekUcAqNV0X9) and also on the [React Wednesday homepage](https://www.telerik.com/react-wednesdays). I’ll even embed the last episode right here because I’m such a nice guy.

## How can I join?

Just [join us on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/codeitlive) on 1:00 PM US Eastern time every Wednesday.

You don’t need a Twitch account, but if you have one, you can subscribe to the channel to get notified every time we go live.

## Anything else I should know?

Twitch is a surprisingly fun place to hang out and chat, and to also learn stuff from React experts at the same time.

We’re having fun with this, and we hope you will too. [Join us!](https://www.twitch.tv/codeitlive)
