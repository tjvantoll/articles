# Webinar: Letâ€™s Build a Financial Dashboard with React

The great thing about building financial apps is that thereâ€™s very little data, and therefore very little complexity.

Ok fine, financial apps are hard. They typically they deal with a ton of data, and displaying that data in a meaningful way is critical to making your users happy and productive.

Enter the dashboard, the app that your bossâ€™s boss is pretty sure you can throw together in a week or two, but that you know involves a lot of complexity.
