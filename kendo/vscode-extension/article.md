# Announcing the Kendo UI Template Wizard for Visual Studio Code

One of our goals on the Kendo UI team is to help you build great apps fast. With that in mind, today weâ€™re happy to announce a new [Kendo UI Template Wizard](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=KendoUI.kendotemplatewizard) for Visual Studio Code ðŸŽ‰

The template wizard allows you to quickly scaffold  React and Angular applications using an easy-to-use tool built directly into Visual Studio Code.

In this article youâ€™ll learn how to install the extension, and how to use it to create powerful Angular and React applications.

## Installation

The Kendo UI Template Wizard is a Visual Studio Code extension, and as such youâ€™ll need to have [Visual Studio Code installed](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to use it.

Once you do, open Visual Studio Code, head to the extensions tab (#1 in the image below), and use the search bar (#2 in the image below) to search for **Kendo UI Template Wizard**.

Select the Kendo UI Template Wizard and then click the green **Install** button to add the extension to Visual Studio Code.

And... thatâ€™s it! You now have the extension installed and ready to go, so letâ€™s see what it can do.

## Using the extension

To launch the Kendo UI Template Wizard youâ€™ll need to use the Visual Studio Code command pallette, which you can open with `Ctrl + Shift + P` (`Cmd + Shift + P` on macOS). With the pallette open, search for the **Kendo UI Template Wizard Launch** option, and select it to launch the wizard.

From here, the process of building an app is pretty simple. First give your project a name and path.

Next, select whether youâ€™d like to use React or Angular.

For the third step, you can create pages that you want to appear in your new application. Currently the wizard allows you to start pages from four pre-configured templates: Blank, Form, Grid, and Chart. If youâ€™re trying the wizard for the first time, go ahead and create a page using each type so you can see how everything works.

And then for your last step, choose which of the preconfigured Kendo UI themes youâ€™d like to start your app with. (And youâ€™ll be able to configure your themes later on.)

Next, click the create button, and the wizard will generate your new application, as well as a link to open that app up in Visual Studio Code.

With your app now created and ready to go, letâ€™s look at what you can do with it.

## Running your app

To run your app youâ€™ll first need to install its npm dependencies by running `npm install` from your terminal or command prompt.

> **TIP**: You can open your terminal or command prompt directly in Visual Studio Code using <code>Ctrl+\`</code>.

Next, run your app using `ng serve` for Angular or `npm run start` for React.

And just like that, you now have a multi-page application set up and ready to go!
